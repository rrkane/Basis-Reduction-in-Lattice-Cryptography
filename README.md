Basis Reduction in Lattice Cryptography
============

My honors thesis at Colby College. I explored the mathematical underpinnings of reduction algorithms which break lattice cryptosystems. I was advised by Professor Nora Youngs.

This repository holds the tex source, the styles, and the compiled pdf. I haven't uploaded the makefile.

I used the excellent tex template provided by [alexjbest](https://github.com/alexjbest/partiiiessay).
